## 1. Open Model RAG vs. No RAG Comparison

- [RAG v. No RAG Model T Output](./outputs/e1_modelT.txt)

- [RAG v. No RAG Congressional Record Output](./outputs/e1_CR.txt)

Does the model hallucinate specific values without RAG?

Does RAG ground the answers in the actual manual?

Are there questions where the model's general knowledge is actually correct?

## 2. Open Model + RAG vs. Large Model Comparison

- [GPT 4o Mini Model T Output](./outputs/e2_modelT.txt)

- [GPT 4o Mini Congressional Record Output](./outputs/e2_CR.txt)

Does GPT 4o Mini do a better job than Qwen 2.5 1.5B in avoiding hallucinations?

Which questions does GPT 4o Mini answer correctly?  Compare the cut-off date of GPT 4o Mini pre-training and the age of the Model T Ford and Congressional Record corpora.

Where does the frontier model's general knowledge succeed?

When did the frontier model appear to be using live web search to help answer your questions?

Where does your RAG system provide more accurate, specific answers?

What does this tell you about when RAG adds value vs. when a powerful model suffices?
