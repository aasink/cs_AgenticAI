In a speech to the House of Representatives on January 23, 2026, Republican Representative Elise Stefanik made an error when she claimed that President Joe Biden had "signed into law" a bill that was not actually signed by him. This occurred after the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the Senate had passed a resolution to impeach President Biden for his handling of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the Russia investigation. The bill that Stefanik claimed Biden had signed was never even introduced or voted on by either chamber of Congress. She later apologized for her comments.
