To ensure reliable ignition, it's recommended to check the magneto contact post. This involves shorting the magneto contact post while someone cranks the car and making sure a good live spark occurs. Additionally, if necessary, the strength of the magneto can be checked by running wires from a battery to various points on the engine to see if they produce a strong spark. If any magnets are found to be weak or broken, new ones should be installed. Furthermore, the flywheel ring gear should also b...

driver back and forth on the cover to make a good contact.
  If a good live spark occurs the magneto is 0. K. (See Par. 999) . If no
  spark or a very weak spark occurs, remove magneto post and examine
  contact spring to see that it is not weak, or broken, or that there is no
  dirt or foreign matter between the contact and contact post spring.
  After cleaning the contact point and contact post, replace magneto
  terminal and again short the terminal to cover.
============================================================

To keep the magneto working well, you should first check if there's any end play in the crankshaft by removing the magneto post and examining the contact spring. If everything seems fine, then you can test the magneto using a simple method where you connect wires from a battery to the terminals of the magneto, ensuring a good spark occurs. If no spark happens, clean the contact points and springs thoroughly before reattaching them. This will help ensure the magneto remains operational. Additiona...

            Testing the Strength of the Magnets




                                    Fig. !88




276  The magnets are checked for strength with a magnet tester. The
 tester is placed between the ends of the magnets so that the poles on
 the tester come in contact with both sides of the magnet (See Fig.
 188) . The operation is repeated until each magnet has been checked.
 If the magnets are at full strength a reading of SO units or more
 should register on the dial.
============================================================

To determine if the magneto needs attention, you can check its strength using a magnet tester. Place it between the ends of the magnets and repeat this process for each magnet. A reading of 45 units or higher indicates that the magnets are strong enough. However, if any of the magnets are found to be weak or broken, they should be replaced as indicated in the text. Additionally, inspecting the flywheel ring gear for worn or broken teeth is also important. Lastly, checking the ignition system for...

  The magneto should generate at least 7 volts at 400 R. P. M.
995   If magneto fails to generate 7 volts, one or more of the magneto
  coils are shorted or the magnets are weak. To remedy these troubles
